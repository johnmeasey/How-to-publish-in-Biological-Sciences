This version is just a taster for what will come once the call is open (see There is a Plan!). Cover illustration: The Garden of Earthly Delights (right panel) was adapted by the author from an original work by Hieronymus Bosch (1504) painted to depict a representation of hell.

"],["welcome.html", "Welcome", " Welcome Sharing our successes and forgetting how we got there is not a true reflection of the pains that many successful biologists go through when publishing their work. This book openly shares the personal struggles behind the successes in many different published papers in the Biological Sciences. In doing so, this book represents a reflective experience for those who author chapters about their work, in order to look for the positive in what might otherwise be regarded as a thoroughly negative experience. Negative peer review, random editorial decisions and downright unfair rejections; weve all been there. For those who read the chapters of this edited work, the shared community of practice represents an insight into the failures that everyone goes through - even though you might only see the success. In addition, you will learn some tricks of our trade, how to prepare yourself and face the inevitable failures, and keep your eye on the eventual success on your own publishing journey. Perhaps most importantly, this book provides inspiration for those of you who feel that you might want to give up. Publishing your work is very important, and we all want you to succeed, but sometimes you will need to persevere before you see your research in print.

Software information and conventions Acknowledgments", " Requirements for contributors If you want to contribute to this book, there are a few requirements: You must have published the paper that your story is about, and provide a link to the paper, and if possible the online reviews You should have been the principle author and/or the corresponding author This should have been an important paper for you personally, and preferably have some importance for others in your field. If its not been a big deal for you, then its not likely to make a good back story Use the first person singular pronoun to tell your story This is not an opportunity for ad hominem attacks, so please avoid the names of individuals if you are not being positive about them Make it personal and please do share your feelings. We want to know about the low times, but we also want to know what helped you through them Use the exercise as an opportunity to reflect on your experience, and provide ideas that might help others who are faced with a similar situation Promote solutions. We know that the current world of publishing is not ideal. Provide some ideas for what you think might have worked better in your situation Formula for contributors There is no compulsory formula, and you are welcome to write your story in your way. The preference if for you to meet all of the requirements above, but we remain flexible. Remember that the audience is Early Career Researchers (ECRs), and that your contribution is expected to resonate with them and to inspire them to continue sending their manuscripts to journals even after rejection. If you want some pointers of how you could structure your chapter, then please see the outline below: Introduction: Tell us a little about you at the time that the study, and the write-up took place: what stage of your career were you at where in the world were you what was your home story at the time anything else that we need to know in order to appreciate your feelings and attachment to the study itself Back-story to the study: Briefly outline what the study was about: the approach &amp; ideas time taken to collect the data the other co-authors anything else relevant to understand the completion of the study and its write-up The first submission where did it go how long did it take what was the outcome what did you learn The second submission see the first submission Repeat until accepted Reflect on your experience: What were the major changes that you made to the manuscript between the first submission and acceptance Who made the difference between the rejections and acceptance of your paper and what did they do? What were the major lessons that you learned, and how has this changed your approach to publishing moving forwards? What advice can you give to Early Career Researchers who might be in the middle of their biggest publishing story, but not at the point where they have had their manuscript accepted? Figures  Pictures often say more than youd imagine. You should add a figure that you can link to in your story. If you can, provide a picture or two that adds something personal to you. Please avoid using any previously published images. If you do and your chapter makes it into the book, well be asking you to provide copyright permission. Of course, if they are published CC-BY then theres no problem. Figure captions  Figure captions need to include a figure title (in bold), and a full description (one to two sentences). For examples, see Figures 10.3 and 5.2. Additional References  In addition to the paper that you are talking about, you might want to cite additional papers that inspired you. This is all good, but you must supply the complete citation and DOI (if possible). Format  You can use any format (e.g. *.rmd; *.rtf; *.docx; *.txt) to write your chapter, but they will all be converted to R Markdown for inclusion into the Bookdown version. For details see here. Thus, R Markdown is best! Send me your chapters You can send chapters directly to me at john@measey.com, or DM me on Twitter @AfriHerp. There is a plan! Preliminary chapters published here: these will be edited and added as they come until November 2021. These chapters will be used to submit the book as a concept to a publisher. Publishers will have to conform to the content remaining online Open Access online using Bookdown (Xie, 2016a). Once contracted, ~5 ECRs will be selected as reviewers for submissions ideally from diverse areas of the Biological Sciences: Cell Biology; Genetics; Ecology; Evolution; Physiology. (Im open to persuasion here, so tell me why your area should be represented). ECRs will be asked to rank each chapter on its utility toward the ECR target audience, and how likely this is to inspire them to keep publishing. The book will be opened via social media (e.g. Twitter) for ECRs to nominate stories from academics that they would most like to see. All contributions from this round will be added to the online OA book. Reviewer ECRs together with JM will select chapters to be submitted for hard copy published book. The hard copy will have a limited page length (~250 pages), and so chapters will be selected on quality, inspiration and diversity. All chapters will remain in the OA version of the book &amp; the book will remain open for submissions. All chapters will be published CC-BY. It will be written as a live project with a GitHub repository for anyone who wants to contribute, improve, or use as the basis for their own book. The easiest way for readers to contribute content directly is through a GitHub pull requests. At the repository for this book, you will find Rmd files for each chapter, and as a GitHub user, you can simply edit the Rmd file and submit the changes.

Most of my published papers were first rejected by a different journal than the one they ended up being published in. That includes almost all of my best-cited papers. I have learned to move on after a rejection, revise the manuscript if there were any comments and send it to the next journal. I dont spend a lot of mental energy on past rejections and therefore cant remember many of them in detail. There are a few, however, that I remember clearly. 1.1 Blue cranes in the Karoo I was a postdoc at the time, and interested in demography and population ecology. Mark Anderson who was then the provincial ornithologist in Northern Cape province (South Africa) sent me mark-recapture data that he and his team had collected on blue cranes, Anthropoides paradiseus, over 12 years. I was very excited. Not only are blue cranes really beautiful birds and the South African national bird (Figure 1.1), the data also gave us some really interesting insights into how environmental variation can affect populations. When demographic parameters  age-specific variation in survival and reproduction  vary from year to year, this normally has a negative effect on population growth. The Karoo is a semi-arid area in South Africa and in (semi-)arid areas, variability in rainfall is a key driver for most biological processes as it makes demographic parameters vary over time. We found that the cranes were particularly successful at reproducing in years that had unusually large amounts of rain. We realised that environmental variability can have a positive effect on population growth if the relationship between the driver (rainfall in our case) and the demographic parameter (reproduction in our case) is convex. We submitted the manuscript to Journal of Animal Ecology where it got rejected largely because the reviewers could not wrap their heads around the idea that environmental variation can actually increase population growth, which went against the conventional wisdom at the time. Oikos also rejected our manuscript for similar reasons. We finally got it published in Functional Ecology (Altwegg &amp; Anderson, 2009) and the idea has been confirmed by other studies since then. FIGURE 1.1: A colour-ringed blue crane, Anthropoides paradiseus, in the arid Karoo of South Africa. Knowing how many birds were ringed and resighted over time gave us the information needed to estimate survival. Photo: Mark D Anderson 1.2 Sociable weavers Another long-term project that Mark Anderson initially started and that has since become one of the most detailed demographic study on birds in South Africa is on Sociable Weavers, Philetairus socius, near Kimberley. These birds live in colonies centred on large communal nests that they build mostly in trees (Figure 1.2). Mark Anderson, Rita Covas and others had collected demographic information on thousands of individual weavers living at \\(\\sim\\) 20 colonies over \\(&gt;\\) 15 years, which gave us an opportunity to examine meta-population dynamics in unique detail. We sent the manuscript to the Journal of Animal Ecology (again) and received a decision of Major Revision. The reviewer comments were quite extensive but we felt that we were able to address all of them. The editor also asked us to make time-consuming changes to get the manuscript in line with specific journal requirements. Our re-submission was reviewed again  and then rejected, largely due to a misunderstanding on part of one of the reviewers about the statistical methods we had used! The reason why this rejection still lingers in my memory is because it felt like such a waste of time and resources back then. We did eventually get the paper published in Oecologia (Altwegg et al., 2014), and I believe it is still one of the most detailed demographic studies of a complex meta-population. FIGURE 1.2: Sociable weavers, Philetairus socius, inhabit the arid parts of southern Africa. They build large communal nests that can be home to hundreds of birds. We examined the metapopulation dynamics of a collection of such colonies near Kimberley, South Africa. Photos: Res Altwegg (nest), Mark D Anderson (bird). 1.3 The view from the other side One thing that has helped me deal with manuscript rejections is my involvement with the editorial process as reviewer and especially as editor. I have reviewed about 250 manuscripts and handled close to another 500 manuscripts as an editor. This has taken up a lot of my time. And it has helped me better appreciate the time others spend commenting on my work. I think its fair to assume that editors never take the decision to reject a manuscript lightly. I remember some of the rejections I made as an editor at least as well as I remember getting my own papers rejected. Rejections happen because the editor feels that the manuscript does not fit with the aims of the journal. Perhaps the data do not allow for the types of insights to be gained that the journal expects. Perhaps the goal of the study simply isnt within the scope of the journal. The decision to reject is not always clear. Some of the more memorable cases were manuscripts that I initially felt unsure whether they would be suitable for the journal but decided to obtain the opinion of others and sent them out for review. Some of them came back with mixed reviews and I decided to give the authors the benefit of the doubt and invited a revision. In a few cases, manuscripts went through another round of review after which it became clear to me that they would not make the cut. I can imagine that these authors felt as I had after having my Sociable Weaver manuscript rejected. And therefore, as an editor, I always did my best to avoid these situations. Giving a marginal manuscript a chance is not always kind to the authors So here are a few lessons I have learned about the publication process. The process is not perfect but it is fair to assume that editors and reviewers spend quite a bit of time and effort on your work, even if the outcome is disappointing for you or feels unfair. Appreciate any comments you get and do your best to improve your manuscript before resubmitting. It feels really bad as a reviewer if you are being asked to review the same manuscript again for a different journal and you see that all your earlier comments were completely ignored. Also, never send angry letters to editors  that really is inconsiderate. Finally, getting a desk rejection can feel particularly bad but is usually not an indication that the editor did shoddy work. Be grateful for a quick decision that allows you to move on and submit elsewhere. References Altwegg R, Anderson MD. 2009.

Blackburn Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research, Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London, London WC1E 6BT, UK. and Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London, Regents Park, London NW1 4RY, UK. 2.1 Dukkha Its common knowledge that to be an artist is to choose a life of rejection. The struggling genius, unrecognised in their lifetime but venerated after their death, is something of a cliché, albeit a source of hope for all those artists whose careers are yet to take off. It was shock for me to discover that a career in science does not inure against rejection. Its part of life for a scientist too. This realisation began to dawn during my D.Phil. More than 30 years on, I can still clearly recall the devastation I felt at the reviews of my first ever submitted manuscript. I can equally clearly remember the response of my supervisor, Paul Harvey  that the comments were actually quite positive, and that the revisions would be followed by acceptance (he was right: Blackburn, Harvey &amp; Pagel, 1990). With hindsight, my initial dejection was probably driven less by the comments themselves, and more by the process Id gone through to get the manuscript to submission. Id struggled with the concepts that the work was addressing. Getting my head around the statistical concepts needed to test those hypotheses was even harder. Im totally indebted to the incredible patience with which one of the post-docs in the group, (now Professor) Mark Pagel, tried repeatedly to explain them to me. Then, my first draft of the manuscript Introduction came back from Paul with more red pen than printer ink. Yet after all that suffering  which had actually brought me to the point of applying for other jobs  the criticism was not over. This period defined the steepest learning curve of my career. That I managed to scale it was due in large part to the support that I had from Mark, Paul, and other colleagues and friends in that department. As it goes, I escaped from my doctorate very lightly in terms of outright rejection. I managed to publish all of my thesis chapters, with relatively little drama. Despite the teething troubles I experienced during the genesis of Blackburn et al. (1990), that rapidly came to seem like a halcyon period. It was during my time as a postdoc, spanning the 1990s, that the reality of being a scientist started to bite. 2.2 Samudya At this point in my career, most of my work was part of what turned out to be one of the most impressive collaborations in macroecological research with Kevin Gaston, a brilliant scientist, but more, a stalwart friend at a difficult time. Macroecology was still a fledgling field in the 1990s, and one I think its fair to say that Kevin and I helped to develop. At the time, though, that development seemed like an uphill struggle. There was an element in the ecological mainstream that disliked the macroecological approach  or at least, an element in our reviewers. We were criticised for being focused on the documentation and post-hoc explanation of patterns, rather than hypothesis testing, and for addressing phenomena expressed largely at a scale that meant it was unamenable to the scientific gold standard of manipulative experiments. The criticisms were not wrong as such, but equally were not problematic for an approach to ecology that took a broad-scale and comparative perspective. Our manuscripts were nevertheless rejected. A lot. Looking back, it felt like rejection was the norm for anything we tried to publish that decade. Without Kevins support  and that of another mentor, (now Sir) John Lawton  it would have been easy to lose heart. It got to the point where we felt compelled to address the critics head on, and in print. Kevin and I were invited to write a Minireview for Oikos as part of their 50th anniversary celebrations for the Nordic Ecological Society, and our contribution was A Critique for Macroecology (Gaston &amp; Blackburn, 1999; Gaston &amp; Blackburn, 2000), a push-back against those reviewers. The format gave us the freedom to express our opinions on where we thought the barrage of criticism of the field was justified, and where it was not. I dont know if the paper changed any minds, but it felt cathartic. Its mere existence is tangible evidence of the pain of rejection. For me, it was also (along with Gaston &amp; Blackburn 2000) more or less a parting shot from that body of my research. It felt like time to move on. The new millennium brought with it a new research focus, and new collaborators. Id met Richard Duncan when he looked me up on a visit from New Zealand to the U.K. to measure museum specimens, and wed immediately hit it off. We started to work on bird extinctions and alien invasions, applying macroecological approaches to understand drivers of species loss and gain. Through him I met another New Zealander, Phill Cassey (you can read Phills own reflections to find out exactly how), and the two of us forged a close relationship with another invasion biologist, Julie Lockwood, through an NCEAS working group that shed organised. It was an exciting, productive, and fun period for me, and forged lifelong friendships. But even then, the pain of rejection had not disappeared. My manuscripts were still typically getting bounced. Im sorry to say I let the bitterness of my own experience of reviewers motivate my reviews of others. I knew well, back then, that Phill Cassey had also had a difficult time with reviewers  and not just me. It got us wondering  were we special, or did everyone share our pain? We decided to find out. We sent out a short questionnaire to more than 150 of the worlds most published ecologists. It asked for information on how many of their manuscripts in the 1990s had been rejected, and why, and for details of their current position and publication career. Of the sixty-one ecologists who responded, only one claimed not to have had a manuscript rejected in this period. The more papers a scientist published, the more often they experienced rejection. Full professors got rejected more often than other tenured researchers. Essentially, rejection happens to everyone, but it doesnt seem to be a barrier to productivity, or to success (Cassey &amp; Blackburn, 2003, 2004). More catharsis. It didnt make the pain of rejection any less, but at least we knew we werent suffering alone. 2.3 Nirvana The most memorable example of rejection in my career happened around the time Phill and I were working on these rejection studies. Wed assembled a dataset that combined information on alien mammal species established on oceanic islands around the world with information on the number of native bird species that had gone extinct from those same islands. Our analyses were exciting. We could show that the number of extinctions was related to three variables: island area, maximum elevation on the island, and the number of alien mammal predator species. The effect of predators was greater on endemic birds  exactly those we expect to be more naïve to their impacts. Surely evidence that bird extinction probability was related to alien predator richness was tabloid-worthy. We wrote up the manuscript and submitted to Nature. We quickly got some good news  theyd sent it out for review! The reviewers recommended rejection. The main criticism of our analysis was that our data included extinctions that were prehistoric (albeit post colonisation by humans), while most alien mammal predators were introduced following the discovery of the islands by Europeans. Fair enough  we needed to dig into faunal changes pre- and post-European arrival. We re-ran the analyses using only historic extinctions and introductions: the results held. We rewrote the manuscript focussing on the historic era, reformatted it, and sent it to Science. We quickly got some good news  theyd sent it out for review! The reviewers recommended rejection. The main criticism of our analysis was that it did not consider prehistoric extinctions. I suspect that our howls could be heard in the next county. I still have a copy of the letter I wrote back to the editors at Science. Its long, but heres a sample: the basis of review 1 [Its not always Reviewer 2] is a single argument: that our results are a function of a failure to address pre-historic extinctions and introductions. Yet, this is a criticism that we specifically and explicitly refuted in the Supplementary Material, where we noted that A significant effect of predator species number is still observed if the analysis is expanded to include pre-historic mammal introductions and bird extinctions (Materials and Methods, paragraph 2). Indeed, our results are supported by analysing pre-historic and historic data together. Our sense of injustice was magnified because not ony was the criticism unjustified, but we had also actually included the relevant information in our original submission. To Sciences credit, they were sympathetic to the arguments in my strop, and sent our manuscript out for adjudication. Reviewer 3 was positive. So were the editors. We were in (Blackburn et al., 2004)! FIGURE 2.1: Taking time out from science during the Society for Conservation Biology conference in Brasilia, 2005. The author (left), with sometime co-authors Richard Gregory (second left), John Ewen (third right) and Phill Cassey (right). One of these people is not really a birdwatcher. 2.4 Magga Doing science is not easy. It requires creativity. It requires hard and often tedious work. The end product is a manuscript (hopefully to become a published paper) that the scientist believes contains a true description of some small part of nature. Its difficult then to be told that your truth is wrong. Its worse if its considered so wrong that your manuscript is not worth publishing. Potentially, its years of hard grind down the pan. Ive had 30 years of experience of this process now. It has at least taught me a few things. First off, Im not alone. Everyone gets manuscripts rejected. If you havent, you will. This knowledge doesnt necessary stop the pain of rejection, but at least your colleagues will understand. Second, you dont have to take rejection lying down. Sometimes the reviewers are just wrong. That may be because you didnt do a great job of explaining your position, but it might also be because they didnt bother to read the supplementary material. Ive argued a lot of tosses in my time. To those editors: sorry not sorry. Third, dont let the bitterness infect your treatment of others. For this, I am sorry. With hindsight, issues that seemed huge at the time are barely even memorable. I had lots of manuscripts rejected, but only a handful of specific examples still rankle. All of those manuscripts eventually got published. Finally, what really matters is the support, partnership and friendship that you get from and give to your colleagues. Science is a human endeavour, and increasingly a team game. Its hard, but it can be fun. A lot of the enjoyment comes from the others in your team. Ive been lucky to have met and worked with better people than myself. I hope Im a better person because of them. Be generous, but work with people you enjoy working with. They will help you through the pain. 2.5 Acknowledgements Id like to thank Phill Cassey for sense-checking the manuscript, and the many colleagues, mentors, friends and partners who have helped and supported me over the years, especially (but not only) those mentioned above. With hindsight, its been a lot of fun. References Blackburn TM, Cassey P, Duncan RP, Evans KL, Gaston KJ. 2004. Avian Extinction and Mammalian Introductions on Oceanic Islands. Science 305:19551958.

The emptiness and anger that comes with being told that your research is not good enough to be published. For many this comes during a pivotal time in your research career. This is often at a time when you are completing a postgraduate degree and, if you are like me, competing with overwhelming imposter syndrome. Although, if you listen to most (worthwhile) scientists, while imposter syndrome allays it never entirely goes away. I was privileged during my Master of Science (MSc) degree at Auckland University, New Zealand to have two very different but equally supportive and immensely clever Supervisors  John Craig and Brian McArdle. They were both mentors, colleagues, and friends all rolled together. I published two papers from my MSc within a year of completion, and both manuscripts passed through the review system unscathed and with relative ease (Cassey &amp; McArdle, 1999; Cassey &amp; Ussher, 1999). I was confident, sure of myself, and a bit of an ass. 3.1 It is never really that easy Enter my PhD, and a time of enormous uncertainty. It was as different from my previous experience as I could imagine. Before I commenced my PhD I had worked for six months tutoring at Auckland University. I then travelled for six months camping with two high school friends through the Mediterranean and the Far East. I visited Universities along the way looking for opportunities, but eventually came back to Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia. I had a Scholarship, but no plan. My Supervisor was an unknown quantity, and over the next four years we drifted further and further apart, never managing to get along. Me because I was probably still an ass, and him, well the less said the better. I was struggling, but I had peers who made it worthwhile. Consistently they encouraged me to continue and, at some point at the end of my first year, I wrote a paper. It was a culmination of my own ideas and interests, and what I was learning from the people around me. It was exciting and I was proud of it. I have always missed New Zealand, and I always will. Not in a homesick way, but more like a mourning. I was happy in Brisbane, but this paper connected me back home. It was a study of the dynamics of the land bird fauna in New Zealand, through time, connecting the different periods of human occupation with their extinction and invasion. The paper was a set of ideas that would forge the approach and hypotheses for the rest of my PhD, and for many subsequent papers, grants and collaborations to come. It was also my first (and still one of very few) sole-author papers. I had no-one else to share the highs and lows with. This was my work alone, and only I was to blame for all of its faults. I submitted the paper to the Journal Global Ecology &amp; Conservation Letters. Robert Whittaker was the Editor in Chief and it was a relatively young journal, which I read a lot and greatly admired. I dont remember how many reviews it received, but one review in particular was brutal. The Reviewer had written what seemed like an essay critiquing and criticising the paper  everything from the writing and approach, to the analyses and datasets. And the Review started with one particularly scathing sentence I could never forget: The gulf between this paper and what is expected in an international scientific journal is enormous. Anonymous Reviewer 3.2 How to identify a Reviewer Aside from the length of the Review there were two other noteworthy things about it. The first was that Rob Whittaker apologised in his cover letter for the tone and aggressiveness of the Reviewer. He observed that the topic and analyses were of interest and scope to the journal and that among the vitriol (my own term) there were some useful and constructive comments. If I was willing to work through these then he would consider a revised submission. The effect that this small act of positive encouragement had on me was immense. The second was that the Reviewer had cited six published papers from one particular author, Tim M Blackburn, throughout the Review. I knew Blackburns work well. His paper Animal body size distributions: patterns, mechanisms and implications with Kevin Gaston (1994) was one of the first papers I remember reading and thinking: Shit, science is cool. I want to be a scientist! Now I was faced with the realisation that Tim M Blackburn had (with all statistical likelihood) either reviewed my paper, and hated it  or been the victim of some very perverse Reviewer identity fraud. A PhD is a wonderful time. It is a time of longstanding friendships and huge personal sacrifice and development. Despite the trauma of the rejection, I ultimately knuckled down and revised the manuscript. I took advantage of Rob Whittakers offer to resubmit the revised paper, and it was published in March 2001. This was the first empirical chapter of my PhD (Cassey, 2001). On December 11th 2001 I submitted my PhD, and within a week I was back in New Zealand and travelling to Christchurch to meet with Richard Duncan at Lincoln University. Richard had recently published two articles that were very similar to the subject of my PhD (Blackburn &amp; Duncan, 2001a,b), and I had written to him expressing an interest in the work and a desire to discuss my own research with him. He had invited me to come to Christchurch to give a seminar on my PhD and meet a colleague of his who was visiting from the United Kingdom  Tim M Blackburn. 3.3 You might say the rest is history I went to Christchurch met with Tim and Richard, we talked a lot, drew on whiteboards, ate curry, drank beer  and I missed my flight home. At one point, walking towards the café for lunch, I asked Tim if he had reviewed my paper. I dont remember his response. Tim and I have published over 50 papers together, many of these with Julie Lockwood  who reviewed my PhD Thesis and was one of the first people to try and persuade me that Tim was not a complete bastard. The three of us have become very good friends (Figure 3.1). I never talked to my PhD Supervisor again, but I owe much of my good fortune and career success to my first bad Reviewer and my PhD Assessor. It is not always clear, nor predictable in science or life, who our best mentors, colleagues and friends will be. Tim is not the only person to have insulted my papers. Stuart Pimm (in a signed review) once called my work slop bucket, but the funny thing is that Tim and Julie were also co-authors on that paper. You are not always going to know who your Reviewers are, and youre even less likely to be best man at their wedding. However, the thing with peer-review is that Reviewers are always other researchers. You will quite likely meet them one day, at a Conference, on a Zoom Working Group, in a pub, and no matter how rude they are in their Reviews, and how much you hate them at the time, the chance to improve your work and submit it again is almost always a good thing. FIGURE 3.1: The only Science paper I have ever written. Phill Cassey and Tim M Blackburn in Benneydale, New Zealand, circa 2004. The best place in the world to write a Science paper.

Just kidding. It actually is really quite rewarding to see your work in print (virtual as that may be these days). And, I do encourage it early, and often, for my own undergraduate and graduate students. But, I do feel like I need to put a little safety bubble around them when they are first starting out. Bear in mind that I, myself, have never had a paper published by a journal without receiving a request for fairly major revisions, to this date. So, I write this article from the perspective of serving on the editorial boards now of several journals, and serving presently as the Senior Executive Editor of the journal Functional Ecology. I may have been around a while, in academic terms, but some of the scars from my early years as a developing author still feel as fresh as the day they arrived (yes, I have been around long enough that my first few manuscripts were printed and sent via snail mail, in an envelope!). So, I write this piece now thinking of my own experience as an author, and I reiterate that, even with these editorial positions under my belt, I still get reviews that ask for quite major revisions from me, nearly every time (Figure 4.1). It happens to us all, and it is a reflection of the process. We dont outgrow this kind of feedback, we just get thicker skins. FIGURE 4.1: Escaping from the editors jaws. Lara Ferry is the Principle Investigator of the Functional Morphology lab in Arizona State University. 4.2 Focussing on the why The process is pretty trimmed down, especially these days. Only a couple of people read your paper  two, maybe three reviewers, maybe an associate editor, an editor  and they are doing their best to make sure that only really good work gets into the journal. And, that is a good thing. Editors have to keep a lot of things in mind, not just if the paper is good. It has to be the right fit for the journal. That might feel a little unfair. But readers know to go to certain journals for certain kinds of information. And, journals have to survive, and to survive, they need readers. The singular and imperfect measure of this is Impact Factors, and the like, but that is a rant for another day. You should view the really critical comments on your paper as the generous gift that they are. Painful, possibly, yes. But, writing those kinds of reviews is incredibly time consuming. And, typically, a review is something that faculty member X had to do at home, at night, as it couldnt be fit into the regular work day of teaching, researching, serving, etc. So, read the review, set it aside, and then come back to it when the feelings have subsided a little and re-read it as the supportive document that it was meant to be. Someone, probably someone you dont even know, has taken time to try improve your work sufficiently for it to be published in a journal. Make the changes (dont argue with this person who has given you this gift). If the reviewer misunderstood what you, the author, meant, rewrite it. That is on you, not the reviewer. And, so on. 4.3 Sometimes it gets personal Of course, we have all seen the reviews where it got personal. The reviewer felt compelled to fix something, probably not you, the author, and was going to do it through the review. So, they are really over critical. These are actually really rare. Yes, these folks exist. Good editors learn about them and weed them out of the system. If you think you got an unfair review from one of these kinds of people, and it didnt get addressed by the editor, reach out. Let the editor know your thoughts. Politely, please, editors are people too. But, editors are here to help you through the process, and to help young writers learn their craft. Bear in mind too that this profession we are in, which requires academic publishing, and perhaps all of academia, if you are in that line of work, is based, exclusively, on negative feedback. We cut our teeth as young scientists, in graduate school, in the Journal Club or some group meeting with the universal and singular goal to review important papers in the field. Review, in nearly every case, equates to shred. We are trained, like lion cubs, to go for the kill. This means that the fact that you only got negative feedback on your manuscript, and that it feels picked over like buzzards were at a road kill, isnt personal, and is merely the current culture of academia. I am not saying this culture is good, or defending it in any way. I am just saying that is how it is, at least at present. I hope for a day when this isnt the case any longer, and I do see the culture shifting to one that is much more supportive of young authors (this book is a case in point). But, we have a way to go still. 4.4 Youll need a support system So, build your support system, and rely on it in as you develop your writing prowess. Know that you will continue to need them, and think of them as a lifelong network. I am reminded of a semi-recent paper with a collaborator with whom I have worked with every now and then since we were in graduate school together, Dr. Alice Gibb. The paper was rejected from Science, and a few other places, before it landed at a nice, respectable outlet, PLOS ONE (Boumis et al., 2014). Once it was published, a writer from Science reached out, and the publication was subsequently featured as a highlight. Wed gone full circle! On reflection, the paper was too weird for most places. It was about fish jumping on land. Yes, that odd behaviour that a fish does when you place it where it does not want to be, high and dry. I add here, many an editor (and colleague!) told us there was nothing of value in watching fish flop about on land. Turns out there is a fair bit of coordination to that behaviour that just looks like thrashing about to you and I. Alice had the good sense to take a closer look, I was lucky enough to be invited to come along on the journey. Turns out Alice and her team, and partly me, uncovered a really cool system, that explains how fish get back to the water when they find themselves stranded, how they sense what to do, and how it just might explain the underlying mechanism that facilitated the all-important transition from water onto land in our evolutionary history. The moral of this story is, if the work is interesting to you, dont give up on it. Uncover the thing that is driving your interest, and, use your passion to tell your story. The greatest discoveries are made this way. Go figure. You never know where the road is going to take you when you embark upon it. But, take the journey, and be open to its twists and turns.

This was part of several predator translocations that were occurring throughout the Eastern Cape Province at that time (Hayward et al., 2007a). I had finished my PhD six months earlier on the conservation ecology of the quokka Setonix brachyurus in the Western Australian jarrah forest, and had just completed a short post-doc at the Walter Sisulu University (also in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa), when I moved down to live in the research area of the staff village in Addo. I lived in a 3m x 4m hut (known as a Wendy hut, because it was only big enough to fit Peter Pan and Wendy; Figure 5.1). With me in the research area, there was a team of black rhino Diceros bicornis researchers from New Zealand, an elephant Loxodonta africana researcher from Ireland, and some Germans researching southern red bishops Euplectes orix. FIGURE 5.1: Life inside a 3m x 4m uninsulated Wendy hut in Addo Elephant National Park in mid-summer. My research assistant was at pains to model an authentic South African National Parks towel in all its glory. In November 2003, six lions Panthera leo were released from soft release bomas into the Addo Main Camp section. My job was to determine how they fared and what the impacts were. It was an amazing experience. We were fully immersed in our study species. Generally, I would drive out each morning to see what the lions had been up to overnight  as each had radio collars (Figures 5.2 and 5.3). Twice each season my girlfriend (now wife Gina) and I would live in the back of our research vehicle for 5 consecutive days following individuals as this is the most robust way to determine their diet, movements and what species they encounter (Mills, 1992). We also drove transects each season to determine the density of all potential prey species. We fell in love with South Africa and its people. FIGURE 5.2: Each day my wife, Gina, and I would venture out into Addo Elephant National Park to see what the lions had killed. We also performed continuous follows where we lived in the vehicle for 96 consecutive hours to determine the movement patterns, hunting success rates, prey encounter rates and diet of the lions and spotted hyaenas. 5.2 Back story Very soon after the release of the lions, I started finding Cape buffalo Synceros caffer carcasses. The lions had been translocated from the Kalahari-Gemsbok National Park about 1000 km to the north, and which is a very different (desert) biome to that found at Addo (sub-tropical thicket biome). Hence, we were unsure of what they would eat, and one of the first conversations I had with the regional manager of South African National Parks, Lucius Moolman, was what their diet would be in Addo. Coming from Australia, I had pretty much no idea what theyd eat, so I stupidly assured Lucius that theyd probably eat what they had eaten in the Kalahari. He shook his head and patiently said Matt, those lions come from the Kalahari. None of the animals they ate up there live down here. So I thought some more, and offered the suggestion that Id read that lions were generalist predators (Schaller, 1972) and hence they would probably eat the most abundant species in Addo. Again, Lucius shook his head and highlighted that elephants were one of the most abundant species in Addo, and he couldnt see the lions focusing on them. So I set about doing some research to answer Lucius question. I thought that if I could determine what lions prefer to prey on throughout the rest of their distribution, it would give me a good idea of what they would eat in Addo. Over the next 6 months, I reviewed the literature on lion diets and related what they killed to the available prey at each study site. I discovered that lions kill five species more frequently than you would expect based on their relative abundance within the prey communities where they exist: blue wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus, plains zebra Equus quagga, giraffe Giraffa cameleopardalis, Cape buffalo, and gemsbok Oryx gemsbok, and they prefer prey weighing between 90 and 550 kg (Hayward &amp; Kerley, 2008). I thought this was a great discovery. Now I could predict the diet of lions at Addo (which we subsequently did with high accuracy; Hayward et al. (2007b)). Graham reviewed the paper and was happy to be a co-author, so I submitted it (I think it was to the Journal of Animal Ecology). I thought the research was internationally relevant and important in that it offered a way to predict the diet of a predator and the methods could be used for all other large predators that had been sufficiently studied. It got desk rejected without being sent for review. I then submitted it to other international journals (I think Journal of Applied Ecology, Oikos, Proceedings of the Royal Society, Ecology and a couple of others). It was massively disheartening with most rejections being because the results were not considered of international importance. After almost a year, we submitted the manuscript to the Journal of Zoology and got two excellent reviews  one by an anonymous referee and the other by Rob Slotow. The reviews were excellent because they were critical but offered specific advice on how to improve the manuscript. These were not methodological changes, but rather ways to emphasise the international relevance of our work. We did this and the paper was finally published in 2005: Hayward &amp; Kerley (2005). FIGURE 5.3: All reintroduced predators were fitted with radio collars. This female (Kamqua) was the first to successfully breed in Addo for over 100 years, and the park staff generously named her cubs after my wife and I. 5.3 The outcome Since publishing that first paper on lion prey preferences (Hayward &amp; Kerley, 2005), I recognised the important results it yielded on the critical prey requirements of the lion and that this would be important knowledge to help conserve all large predators. Hence, I expanded this field of research by investigating other large predators in Africa from leopards Panthera pardus (Hayward et al., 2006a), to cheetahs Acinonyx jubatus (Hayward et al., 2006b), spotted hyaenas Crocuta crocuta (Hayward, 2006), African wild dogs Lycaon pictus (Hayward et al., 2006c), and jackals (Hayward et al., 2017; Hayward et al., 2018). When youre on a winner, you should stick to it  so I extended the species studied to large predators on other continents, including tigers Panthera tigris (Hayward, Jdrzejewski &amp; Jêdrzejewska, 2012), dholes Cuon alpinus (Hayward, Lyngdoh &amp; Habib, 2014), and jaguars Panthera onca (Hayward et al., 2016). I have also had students or collaborators who have extended this research to chimpanzees Pan troglodytes (Bugir, Butynski &amp; Hayward, 2021), snow leopards Panthera uncia (Lyngdoh et al., 2014), wolves Canis lupus (Jdrzejewski et al., 2012), brown bears Ursus arctos (Niedziakowska et al., 2019), Pleistocene predators (Valkenburgh et al., 2016) and even humans (Bugir et al., 2021). This research has led to an ability to accurately predict the diet of lions (Hayward et al., 2007b), and determine the number of large African predators that can be sustained at a site based on the available prey communities (Hayward, OBrien &amp; Kerley, 2007; Hayward &amp; Kerley, 2008). The relationships we discovered between the biomass of preferred prey species and prey within the preferred weight range of lions, leopards and spotted hyaenas has enabled us to determine whether fencing constrains their movements in fenced conservation areas (Hayward et al., 2008). We were also able to reinforce the validity of our results by illustrating that the prey preferences lions exhibit are reinforced throughout the predatory behavioural sequence (Hayward et al., 2011). These papers have been cited almost 3000 times on Google Scholar since 2005, and amass over 180 citations each year (Figure 5.4). Our discoveries have now led to our predictions of carrying capacity to be used in fenced reserves throughout southern Africa (Ferreira &amp; Hofmeyr, 2014), and are being implemented as a way of estimating the number of tigers that can be sustained in tiger sanctuaries in India (Y.V. Jhala, Wildlife Institute of India, pers. comm.). The research has also been acknowledged as some of the few that has yielded real benefits to carnivore conservation (Balme et al., 2014). FIGURE 5.4: Total citations and citations per year of studies that have arisen because of the methods developed in the initial lion prey preferences paper (Hayward &amp; Kerley, 2005). The different species studied are shown along the x-axis while citations (total blue and per annum red) are shown on the y-axis (at the time of writing in September 2021). 5.4 Advice to Early Career Researchers My main advice to people new to academic publishing is to treat publishing as a game  dont take rejections to heart. It really shouldnt be taken too seriously given you have to firstly convince a single Editor to send your manuscript for review. That person may have no idea about your field, or may be having a bad day. They may just miss the point. This is not a metric upon which to base your personal value of your scientific quality. Then you need two referees to view your manuscript supportively. So essentially there are three people you need to satisfy to get your paper published. This is a very small sample size, and they could easily be wrong. Dont give up. If they arent pointing out major methodological problems with your work, dont panic. Use their advice to improve the manuscript, and keep going. The real test is whether your peers see value in your work by citing it  and at ~180 citations per year, Im comfortable the methods are robust and the conclusions valid. I would urge you also to use the referees comments to improve your work. Go through every single comment and, if it is valid, change your manuscript accordingly. Be brave enough to stick to your guns if you disagree, but remember that the referees are likely to be well regarded in the field, so they probably know a thing or two. Hopefully they will be specific in their comments to illustrate exactly what needs to change and how. Use their expertise to your benefit  even if they are mean. 5.5 Another final twist The ecological world seems satisfied with the prey preference research, now readily accepting the methods we have employed on a broad suite of animals. Recently, I took on a student to expand this field of research to look at the prey preferences of hominids  Neanderthals Homo neanderthalensis and anatomically modern humans H. sapiens. The journals she has sent these manuscripts to are largely archaeological and palaeontological (Journal of Human Evolution for example)  and we are getting the same kinds of blow-back. Comments questioning the accuracy of the results because at the site the referee works Neanderthals prefer shellfish rather than large animals, for example, are made. We still get similar concerns raised with our carnivore results on the same grounds  indicating a lack of comprehension that a result from a single site is an anecdote, compared to results from multiple sites throughout a species range. My PhD student is disheartened by these rejections. Sadly, Ive been here before. References Balme GA, Lindsey PA, Swanepoel LH, Hunter LTB. 2014.

Hutchinson Structure &amp; Motion Laboratory, Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, The Royal Veterinary College, London, United Kingdom Im an evolutionary biomechanist; I study how major transitions in locomotor function in vertebrates with limbs have evolved, and often how body size (e.g., gigantism) has played a role in that evolution. So it might come as no surprise that Ive studied dinosaurs. They evolved a huge range of sizes and many forms of locomotion or unusual anatomies that provoke questions about how they functioned or how those functions were transformed. My career as a PhD student began by tackling the question of how the famous gigantic theropod (carnivorous, bipedal) dinosaur Tyrannosaurus rex moved, especially if it could have been fast as some palaeontologists had argued (against expectations from basic biomechanics or patterns in living mammals). We used very simple two-dimensional (2D) biomechanical models (Figure 6.1) to test how big T. rexs leg muscles needed to be to enable fast running, finding that previously claimed speeds &gt;25 mph or so; or especially racehorse-like speeds ~40 mph; were implausible. It is very fair to say that the resulting paper I published in Nature (Hutchinson &amp; Garcia, 2002) with an engineer co-author (thanks to quite supportive peer reviews) is to credit for much of my early career success, and thus for where I am now in my career, too; Ive gotten a lot of mileage out of it. FIGURE 6.1: An old school T. rex model. 2D model of a right hindlimb used to estimate how large muscles needed to be to sustain fast running. Contrast with the anatomical realism of figure 6.2. But I grew to want to move on from T. rex in my career. Frankly, I got tired of T. rex over the years, fascinating as it remains from a biomechanics standpoint (how can a 7000+ kg biped stand and move?). What truly got me excited was how the locomotion of early dinosaurs evolved (back in the Triassic &gt;200 Mya; not the end-Cretaceous ~66 Mya); such as how they became bipeds in the first place, and how their locomotion differed from other, closely related Triassic animals that were forebears to crocodiles. I was lucky (and privileged) again, getting a five-year European Research Council Advanced Investigator Grant (called DAWNDINOS) to study these questions, and do so using cutting-edge 3D biomechanical simulations that were far more anatomically, physiologically and physically realistic than in my PhD work; and set in an explicitly evolutionary context. That DAWNDINOS grant work led tortuously along that cutting edge of 3D simulations. Now acting as a Professor and project manager, very unlike my PhD experience, I learned a lot about what I did not know about the methods we tackled, finding myself deep in the learning curve. It was tough for all of us involved. Finally though, after over two years we made some key progress, and that was because I helped link our team up with external collaborators who really knew those cutting edge simulation methods (developed for studying human locomotion), and they trained my postdoc in those simulation tools. We became able to do what Id wanted to do for my whole career: to build a 3D musculoskeletal model of an extinct dinosaur and estimate how it could, or could not, have moved, using what is called predictive simulation: setting a task for a computer model, given certain inputs or constraints, and having it solve that problem with optimal control theory (e.g., running as quickly as possible). Importantly, we showed in a series of papers that we could do this fairly well (obtaining simulation results that matched experimental measurements) for a living dinosaur; a bird (Bishop et al., 2021b; Bishop et al., 2021c); and that we had a fairly objective, repeatable methodology for making these 3D models in the first place (Bishop, Cuff &amp; Hutchinson, 2021). So we chose a fairly unprepossessing but well studied theropod, Coelophysis bauri (~15 kg biped from ~210 Mya) for our first predictive simulations of an extinct dinosaurs locomotion. Admittedly this was purely exploratory work at first. We just wanted to see what it would do if we asked the simulation to run quickly. It was comforting to find that it produced speeds commensurate with our prior estimates from simpler methods, and it produced forces and motions that matched other independent predictions reasonably well, too. Then, serendipitously, my postdoc was inspecting the output motions of the simulation and realised that the long tail was moving in a consistent, conspicuous pattern. Cleverly, he noticed that as the hindlimb swung backwards with each step, the tail swung toward it. Inspecting more deeply, and using the power of the simulation to change different things such as swing the tail the wrong way or have a heavier tail, he found that the tail of Coelophysis was being used by the simulation to regulate the angular momentum of the whole animal, in an important way; much like humans swing their arms when they walk (Figure 6.2). This regulation makes locomotion more efficient and stable, and arises from the simple physics of motion; not from underlying physiology per se. The postdoc called this some pretty exciting results! and we all agreed, deciding to pitch this study to a high profile journal. 6.1 Submitting the manuscript We submitted our paper to Science on 30 October 2020 and got the desk-rejection notice from the editor on 10 November 2020; not one of the most competitive in terms of general interest studies, we were told. Disappointed but undeterred, we tried Nature (22 November 2020 submission) and received another desk-rejection on 30 November 2020, but with the offer of a transfer to their journal Nature Communications, promising peer review there. We received those reviews 30 March 2021, and the result was rejection. Two reviewers were enthusiastically supportive, urging fairly modest revisions, but a third was unconvincedconceding that this work probably represents the state of the art but they did not feel that the method was mature enough to apply to extinct animals. They seem to have approached the review from the perspective of someone familiar with how these cutting-edge simulations are used for studying human locomotion (and how those have their own, debatable faults), not taking into account that the same standards might not be achievable for other species (living or extinct), yet good progress might still be achievable. But they werent wrong, either; it is just human nature that views on what is good enough in science will differ. As the reviewer acknowledged, And this is a largely qualitative judgement call. Frustrated, we regrouped and resubmitted, with some clarifications in the manuscript about what the simulations could and could not do (and a simulation in which we digitally cut off the tail, showing that it did make a difference), to Science Advances, on 30 March 2021. We obtained constructive reviews with modest revisions, and on 30 July 2021 we were thrilled to obtain the accept decision email (Bishop et al., 2021a)!

Grey tiles = 50 cm. By Peter Bishop. 6.2 Looking back Ive had plenty of truly terrible experiences with peer review in my career, such as reviewers screaming in all-caps or accusing me of bias/conspiracy without any basis. Those kinds of personal attacks are (rare as they are for me; thankfully), as a seasoned veteran, relatively easy for me to shrug off as unprofessionalism. It can be hard, though, in a different way, to accept the loss of control in peer review, as in much of life. My experience with this paper exemplifies how subjective decisions on novelty or broad appeal by editors at glamour mags and by peer reviewers on those aspects as well as technical soundness (which can happen at any journal) are an aspect of peer review that we live with. Innocent, unbiased observation is a myth (Medawar, 2008) applies to job, grant and peer review as it does in so many other realms of human existence. There is randomness, arbitrariness, chaos and unconscious bias that may never be fully extracted from science because humans, not robots (so far), do science. Accepting these facets of science is akin to accepting the existence of an uncaring universe; it is hard. I didnt learn that lesson from this paper; it is something Ive just struggled with throughout my career and life. And that struggle will continue. That is not at all to say we cannot improve peer review; there are ways, for example, to reduce the impact of biases (e.g. DAndrea &amp; ODwyer, 2017); and we can do our best ourselves when we conduct editing and peer review. For early career scientists, I recommend working on accepting that lack of control; it is a valuable life skill. Focus on what you can control; not the yawning void of demoralising uncertainty. A rejection might include hints (or even nicely constructive reviews, which we broadly obtained) of what to change. Its natural to at first rage against a decision that you feel is unfair. Yet, as your passions cool, take the opportunity to calmly inspect what might be improved: maybe you didnt explain some complex methodology well enough, so perhaps some extra text or a workflow figure could help future reviewers and readers understand? Maybe that expert reviewer who misconstrued your analysis did so because you assumed very specialised understanding of your analysis and even just an extra sentence or so could help justify your analysis? You probably know your science best, but that can be to your detriment in peer review: re-read what youve stated by putting your mind in the role of a reader who does not know your science as well as you do. Especially if youre working on some cutting edge of your science, you may lose people off that edge if they cant be led by your manuscript safely along that frontier. And be patient; expect that the process might be slow (especially in these days of the COVID-19 pandemic) but persistence and resilience can still pay off. If you believe in your science, your work will find a home somewhere. Celebrate when it does. References Bishop PJ, Cuff AR, Hutchinson JR. 2021.

Jeschke Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB), Berlin, Germany Institute of Biology, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany Berlin-Brandenburg Institute of Advanced Biodiversity Research (BBIB), Berlin, Germany The paper I chose for my back story was the key outcome of a grant I held from the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft DFG) from 2010 to 2013. The grant paid the postdoctoral position I had at the time in Munich, first at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU), Munichs full university where I was based at the Planegg-Martinsried campus in the southwest of Munich, then at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) where I was based at the Restoration Ecology group located at the Freising-Weihenstephan campus in the northeast of Munich. Earlier in my career, I studied biology at LMU and also completed my doctorate there, however the ecology groups were located in Munichs city centre at that time (before the valuable property was sold, with the university buildings being replaced by expensive apartments and a five-star hotel). After my dissertation, I participated in a project at LMUs Biology Education group and then moved to the USA to do a postdoc with Dave Strayer at the Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, NY, USA, which was later renamed to Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies. Although I was initially a bit skeptical about my life in the USA, particularly as I moved there alone in 2003 and left all my family and friends in Europe (I had not yet met my wife at that time), these two postdoctoral years were truly life-changing for me, both scientifically and personally. I was amazed how quickly I was integrated in the social life and how much I learned from Dave Strayer and other great scientists there. I was very happy to get to know Sujay Kaushal, Lorena Gómez Aparicio and others who were postdocs at the same time in Millbrook, and who became life-long friends. Having had such a great time in Millbrook during my postdoc, I became a Visiting Scientist at the Cary Institute for about a decade (2006-2017), during which I usually visited once or twice a year. It was also in this time period that I worked with my co-authors on the focal paper of this back story: Jeschke et al. (2012b) A related paper is Jeschke et al. (2012a), and both publications resulted from a sub-project we called the Synthesis Project on Invasive Plants and Animals (SPIPA). As Jeschke et al. (2012a) was easier to publish, I focus on Jeschke et al. (2012b) here. Some of the key ideas leading to SPIPA and both papers were facilitated by the inspiring atmosphere of one of my favourite places on the Cary Institutes campus, the Fern Glen (Figure 7.1). FIGURE 7.1: The Fern Glen, an inspiring place on the campus of the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, NY, USA. Many times I enjoyed sitting on one of the chairs (on the right side of the picture), watching, smelling and listening to the Wappinger Creek (on the left side of the picture) and other elements of the fascinating nature around me  and several times I returned to my desk enriched not only by the joy of nature, but also by a thought that turned out to be useful (e.g. Jeschke et al., 2012b). I took this picture in the fall of 2010. 7.1 What the paper is about: zombie ideas and the hierarchy-of-hypotheses (HoH) approach The idea behind the paper was to synthesize available studies on key hypotheses in the field of invasion biology and see how the hypotheses empirical support has changed through time. It goes back to my days as a student that I was often wondering to which degree established hypotheses and concepts that we learn as students from teachers and as researchers from colleagues are actually empirically supported. Identifying what I later learned can be called zombie hypotheses was a key goal of the paper. Jeremy Fox ((2011), based on ideas in Quiggin (Sun, 05/06/2012 - 12:00)) described zombie ideas as follows: Ideas, especially if they are widely believed, are intuitively appealing, and lack equally intuitive replacements, tend to persist. And they persist not just in spite of a single inconvenient fact, but in spite of repeated theoretical refutations and whole piles of contrary facts. They are not truly alive  because they are not true  but neither are they dead. They are undead. They are zombie ideas. Fox (2011) Zombie hypotheses are hampering the progress of science and can lead to ill-informed policy decisions. It is thus important to identify them. At the same time, researchers dont necessarily want to hear that their favourite idea is a zombie and should be buried. I will come back to this point later in lessons learned, when reflecting on why it was hard to get the paper published. Another key aspect of Jeschke et al. (2012b) was how to structure the many empirical tests that have been published on our focal hypotheses. A challenge here is that broad hypotheses are typically not tested in their whole breadth. Instead, a given empirical test usually addresses a specific formulation of a broad hypothesis, and this specific formulation can be called a sub-hypothesis. We realized this was the case for the major hypotheses we looked at in our study, and thus needed a tool to structure the empirical studies we found in the literature. While looking for such a tool and discussing different options, Tina Heger, Sylvia Haider, Anna Pahl (née Liebaug) and I held a workshop in Benediktbeuern near Munich, Germany, titled Tackling the emerging crisis of invasion biology: How can ecological theory, experiments, and field studies be combined to achieve major progress? (March 2010). The discussions there and our work on Jeschke et al. (2012b) led to the hierarchy-of-hypotheses (HoH) approach which was presented for the first time in Jeschke et al. (2012b), and then in Heger et al. (2013) as the publication related to the workshop. Since then, we have further improved and applied the HoH approach (Heger &amp; Jeschke, 2014; Braga et al., 2018; Bartram &amp; Jeschke, 2019; Ryo et al., 2020; Heger et al., 2021), which also led to a book (Jeschke &amp; Heger, 2018) and the Hi Knowledge website featuring an interactive conceptual map of invasion biology where the HoH approach is a key underlying tool. 7.2 The hard road to get the paper published As youd probably expect in a chapter from a book about the struggles to get papers published, the manuscript was rejected by several journals. After having worked on the manuscript for quite some time and being convinced that we produced a great piece of work, we started our submission process in early 2011 with the most prestigious journals, Science and Nature. We did not really expect the manuscript to fly into one of them, but we thought it was worth trying. Well, that dream was over very soon, as the manuscript was desk-rejected in both journals. We then decided to submit to the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA where the manuscript was peer-reviewed, and then rejected. On the positive side, we received concrete criticisms this time that helped us to improve the manuscript, implementing at least those points we agreed with. One criticism was that we should have applied a formal meta-analytic approach. We partly understood and acknowledged this point, but were disappointed that the novelty of our paper was only appreciated by one of the three reviewers. With two reviews being negative, the editor could only reject the manuscript. I would like to make a little side note here, as there has sometimes been confusion about the relationship between the HoH approach and formal meta-analysis: both approaches can easily be combined (see also Heger et al., 2021), and we have done so (Jeschke &amp; Pyek, 2018). In Jeschke et al. (2012b), however, HoH was combined with a semi-quantitative scoring approach, and this attracted criticism. After having been rejected three times, we asked ourselves the What next? question and decided not to give up, but send a presubmission inquiry to Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution (TREE), another high-impact journal. We were happy to receive a positive decision and invitation to submit the full manuscript, which we did. Unfortunately, we received a rejection after peer review in September 2011. The reviews were again mixed, and the sentences we received from the editor were frustrating: While Im confident you would be able to respond successfully to the concerns raised, it is clear to do so would require making the article much too close to primary research. That would take your article out of the remit of TREE. So we revised the manuscript again based on the points made by the reviewers with which we agreed, and set our hopes on success. The next journal we targeted was Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment. Sadly, though, we again received a rejection after peer review. One reviewer was positive overall, but the other one negative, hence the editor declined the manuscript. 7.3 The happy publication end After having been rejected five times, we were not ready to give up and revised the manuscript again based on the most recent comments we received. We did give up on submitting to a high-impact journal, though, and decided to send the manuscript to a promising new open-access journal, NeoBiota. Still being convinced about the quality of our study, we thought we could perhaps even support this young journal by submitting the manuscript there. And this is what happened and led to a happy end of this papers story: We submitted the revised manuscript to NeoBiota in May 2012. This time, we received more positive news after peer review. The editorial decision was major revisions, so we again revised the manuscript based on the new comments we had received and wrote a response letter to indicate how we incorporated each comment. The revised manuscript was accepted by NeoBiota in August 2012. About 1.5 years after the first submission of the manuscript to a scientific journal, it was finally in press ! Although it had a very bumpy start, this paper turned out to become influential. As outlined above, it was the first paper featuring the hierarchy-of-hypotheses (HoH) approach and has thus laid the foundation for many other studies. The paper turned out to really support the journal NeoBiota, as we had hoped, being among the most widely read and cited papers ever published in this journal (having been viewed &gt;28,000 times according to the journals website and cited &gt;275 times according to Google Scholar in November 2021). 7.4 Why was it so hard to get this study published? When submitting this manuscript to a journal, we received partly positive and partly negative reviews in most cases. Editors usually reject manuscripts with such mixed reviews, and this was also the fate of our paper. In particular, while some reviewers liked the study due to its innovativeness and novelty, others criticized our semi-quantitative scoring approach. Both a narrative (qualitative) review and a fully quantitative analysis probably would have been easier to publish. Reviewers usually have a certain expectation on which approach to follow for a particular research question, and while some are happy to see a novel approach, others are more critical and focus on the drawbacks of a new approach as compared to the approach they expected (and probably would have chosen themselves); and since all approaches have some drawbacks, such reviewers typically come to a negative recommendation. Another reason why this paper was hard to get published probably was that its results are rather discomforting. The paper showed that the empirical support of several key hypotheses in the field of invasion biology is relatively low, and have even declined through time overall. This is something we were also quite surprised about, but it might be considered an irritating finding that made it harder to get published. 7.5 What are the lessons learned for publishing papers? Looking back at this paper, and others I have published, I offer three suggestions on how to deal with rejections of submitted manuscripts. First, take reviews seriously. It is important to repeatedly read and reflect on reviews you have received on a submitted manuscript. When I receive reviews, I usually have a quick first look at them. If they are negative, they are sometimes hard to swallow. After a night or two when having digested the disappointment, though, it is easier to read negative reviews in a way that allows me to take advantage of them and find the parts that really help improve the manuscript. Some reviews are clearly full of such constructive points. Others not so, but they can still be helpful when reflecting on them. Points raised by reviewers that I dont agree with are often based on misunderstandings caused by unclear wording, thus realising this also helps improve the manuscript. Dont immediately submit your manuscript to the next journal after having received a rejection. I recommend taking the time to seriously consider the reviews and thoroughly revise the manuscript accordingly. Second, be grateful to reviewers. Independently of whether you agree or disagree with the comments made by reviewers, you should be grateful that they took the time to read, comment and assess your manuscript. Further, you should not waste the time of editors and reviewers by submitting a manuscript to a journal where it clearly does not fit. I always feel a bit guilty when one of my manuscripts had to go through peer review with different journals, as several colleagues had to invest substantial amounts of time for it. This was clearly the case for the focal paper of this chapter. In addition to being grateful that others have reviewed your manuscript, you should also serve as a reviewer of your colleagues manuscripts if you have the opportunity to do so. You dont have to do more than your share, but the peer review system only works if (a) we do not waste the time of reviewers and editors, and (b) we invest time ourselves to review and edit our colleagues manuscripts (cf. McPeek et al., 2009; Lajtha &amp; Baveye, 2010; Kaushal &amp; Jeschke, 2013). Third, believe in your study. Some reviews are ground-shaking and devastating. Here again, it is important to think about such reviews and reflect on your study: Are these reviewers right? In many cases, you will find that while you can follow some critical points made by reviewers, devastating reviews typically ignore the positive aspects of a paper. Taking our focal paper here, while some reviewers had expected a fully quantitative meta-analysis and criticised our paper for the semi-quantitative approach we took, they largely ignored the positive aspects of the study. We were still convinced of the central ideas in our paper and thus didnt give up on it. I recommend that you believe in your study, to remember why you did it in that particular way. It can be, of course, that the reviewers found a fatal flaw that you were not aware of before and that this cannot be corrected, as it lies at the basis of the study. In such a case, the paper should indeed be abandoned, and you can be grateful that the reviewers spotted that fundamental flaw. Most studies are worthy of being published, though, and it is important to get them out there, so that others can benefit from them. Not publishing a study means you and your co-authors are the only ones with access to it, which is against the idea of open science and leads to an increase in dark knowledge (Jeschke et al., 2019). Therefore, being persistent and believing in your study helps you as well as helping science and society at large. 7.6 Acknowledgments I appreciate comments by Tina Heger that helped to improve this chapter.

Their paper was exciting. They were using a phylogenetic approach to show that amphibians, without any doubt, had dispersed over marine barriers. I was fascinated. At the time I had just come back from one such island with an entire set of remarkable, endemic, amphibian species. I settled down to read the paper and was enthused to see what they would say about my study site and the amphibians it contained. But the paper didnt mention them. In fact, before the end of the first paragraph of the introduction, it even denied that their existence: One important argument for such interpretations, ever since Darwin (1859), has been that heretoforth no endemic amphibians were known from oceanic islands.  Vences et al. (2003) The rest of the study was very nice. They went on to explain how they could show that a group of amphibians had crossed an oceanographic barrier. But for me, I was stuck on that first paragraph and that they had completely overlooked my study site when I thought that everyone knew about it. After all, if I knew about it, then surely this group of distinguished German researchers should know? It was 2003, and I was a Marie-Curie Fellow at Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD) stationed at Bondy near Paris. I had already been there 18 months following a couple of short post-docs in South Africa and Brazil. But my fellowship wasnt going particularly well. I had visited the island of São Tomé on the recommendation of Bob Drewes (CalAcad), who Id known for a number of years. Bob had spent nearly an entire conference banging on about São Tomé and how excellent it was, and how easy it was to find my study organisms: caecilian amphibians. FIGURE 8.1: A combination of events started the ball rolling on this manuscript. The publication of Vences et al. (2003), indoctrination from Bob Drewes about São Tomé, and my visits there in search of the cobra bobo (Schistometopum thomense). I emailed Bob, sent him a copy of Vences et al. (2003) and asked how it was possible that they had forgotten about São Tomé, and what were we going to do about setting the record straight. Bob fired straight back that we should contact Vences and ask why they hadnt included the (then) five known endemic species living on the island. Further, we asked whether Miguel would be interested in participating in a paper setting the record straight: that the endemic amphibians of São Tomé had undisputedly colonised the island by crossing a marine barrier, and that this had been (implicitly) known (although admittedly not explicitly stated) for more than 100 years (Bocage, 1873). São Tomé is one in a chain of volcanic islands (~13 Mya) in the Gulf of Guinea with minimum distances of at least 220 km from mainland Africa. The amphibians had been described since the mid-19th century, and their endemism had never been disputed. There followed some discussion and a delay while I went to Amsterdam to meet Miguel and sequence tissue that Bob had collected from an endemic frog (Ptychadena newtoni) from São Tomé. From this point on, what had been intended as a simple reply to Vences et al. (2003) became something far more complex and interesting. I had met oceanographers at IRD who worked in the Gulf of Guinea, and discussed ideas relating to the colonisation events of these islands. Bernad Bourles data on oceanic currents and surface salinity was self-evident when put in this context. Lastly, Martim Melo was studying birds of the Cameroon line, and his expert knowledge about the island endemics was superlative - hence a comprehensive argument could be included about why the frogs had not been carried to the islands by birds. 8.1 Submitting the manuscript The manuscript was finally finished and written up for Biology Letters as it proposed a new explanation about how it was possible for amphibians to cross saltwater barriers using freshwater paths. I was proud of the paper, and I was sure that it was appropriate for Biology Letters. It was submitted in September 2004, and it did get reviewed. One review was favourable, and the other pointed out four putative weaknesses, and suggested that for the paper to be more than conjecture some of these should be strongly supported in order make the paper convincing. I appealed. I wrote a long explanation as to how in fact the manuscript already tackled three out of the four points convincingly, and that the fourth could at least be given a high probability. I have no record of whether or not the appeal was even considered. Presumably not. So I was resigned to picking out another journal. Discussion ensued, and we decided on Journal of Biogeography. This required re-writing the manuscript as a full paper, but on reflection this also allowed me to pull in a lot more of my reading into the manuscript and more convincingly address the points raised by Reviewer #2 from our Biology Letters submission. The new manuscript was submitted to Journal of Biogeography early in 2005, and once again it was reviewed. The reviews took a long time coming. I think I must have written and asked about it as the decision email started with an apology. This time the reviewers were not short and punchy, but very long, asking for a substantial rewrite, and more sequencing of the specimens to produce a more convincing phylogeny. My fellowship had ended and I was unemployed. Still working on manuscripts as well as funding applications, job applications and all those other occupations that make the life of an unemployed Early Career Researcher so much more painful and unfulfilling than those in work. Discussions about the reviews ensued, and it was decided that we needed to do the additional sequencing to produce the new phylogeny, and that this could be done by a new postgraduate of Miguels, Ylenia Chiari, while I got to work rewriting and responding to the text. This was a real low point for me. I had a crisis in confidence as I was an inexperienced researcher trying to head up an important paper with much more senior scientists and fellow ECRs as co-authors. What did they think of how I was handling the manuscript? Had I imagined the importance of this work? Should I rather hand the manuscript over to someone with more experience? At the same time, the slow progress on this manuscript was impeding momentum on my career. I really wanted to be able to have this as a completed project. Lastly, I had that nagging doubt that someone, maybe even the reviewers, would publish on this subject before me. Many people had now seen this idea, and they all had access to similar resources that could provide similar lines of evidence. It was an uncomfortable time during which I came to believe that the manuscript would never be published. That hiatus of doubt, sequencing and rewriting might have lasted as long as a year to 18 months. At long last, the sequencing and reanalysis was done and the manuscript rewritten with the extensive reviewer comments addressed. the manuscript was again ready to submit and send back to Journal of Biogeography. More time passed. This time we managed to get a decision of Minor Revision, but the reviewers wanted us to change the title of the manuscript. They didnt like Freshwater Paths and I felt heartbroken because this was at the crux of the manuscript, the idea that enough freshwater was exiting the Congo River in a very large plume that would lower sea-surface salinity all the way to the Gulf of Guinea islands. Under duress, I changed the title. Happily for me, the Journal of Biogeography handling editor was Bob McDowell. Bob liked the title and urged me to change it back again. He also had quite a lot of suggestions to improve the readability of the text. Suddenly, I felt as if I was turning the corner on this manuscript. An editor liked it and was prepared to make sure that it was as good as it could be before going to print. It did shuttle forwards and backwards again a few times between myself and the Journal of Biogeography editorial team, but by then I had the feeling that it would all come out ok. Things were also looking up for me as I had a new postdoc starting. The paper was published in 2007: Measey et al. (2007). FIGURE 8.2: Time spent on São Tomé also had its ups and downs. My field assistant Quintino Quade celebrates our fantastic haul of caeclians, after a day spent digging in the rain in the islands forested interior. 8.2 Looking back At the time, I would have been happy had the manuscript been accepted in Biology Letters, but it would not have been nearly as good as the manuscript that was accepted at the Journal of Biogeography. The reviewers that I was convinced were trying to make life as difficult as possible for the manuscript, had made it a lot better. I think that the editors of the Journal of Biogeography had made a huge difference in their commitment to getting a good manuscript for their journal. The payoff has been that this has been one of my best cited papers over the years, and its a publication that Im proud of. It introduced me to a better way of collaboration over antagonism when responding to an error made by colleagues, and it resulted in lots of connections with people from other disciplines that I would not have otherwise met. The study has inspired others too. Ive had a bunch of different undergraduates telling me that they read the paper as a part of their course, and enjoyed it (something that doesnt happen too often).

This happened back in the mid 1990s when I had just finished my PhD at University of Connecticut and was also looking for a job somewhere in the world. I was a Colombian-Italian studying in the US, and for reasons known by many, had an eye on Brazil. Indeed, it was in Brazil that I got my first, and only, academic job in the late 1990s. Naturally, I see myself as a senior scientist now, but something that has not changed is a passion for Andean tropical amphibians and their patterns of adaptation to high altitudes. This story, then, starts when I was about to conclude my PhD, and was very proud of my doctoral study. Field-work had been exhausting, though memorable, and wonderful. Also, the study was among the first to analyse evolutionary convergence in the adaptation of tropical anurans to high-elevations, and incorporated a discussion about phylogenetic comparisons that was, at the time, very new. In addition, early presentations of the project were well-received, and I won a best student-presentation at a Society of Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) meeting. I opted to talk about these four papers and not about a single one because this early publication experience shaped many of my views and taught me a lot. I also need to explain that the research reported within these four papers was a coherent composition, an integrated whole. However, it could not be reasonably published in a single paper, so I had organized my findings in four related but self-sufficient parts. The first one covered the thermal sensitivity of locomotion and energetic metabolism, with an evolutionary twist based on a comparison between high-elevation and low-elevation counterparts within given lineages (Figure 9.1. Two more papers were about aspects of behaviour and temperature, and those were naturally aimed at a herpetological community. The last one was a detailed study of thermal ecology and was prepared for an ecological journal. These four papers summarized about four years of work that included a year of field observation and project design, and three years of actual data collection. I submitted these four papers over about one semester. FIGURE 9.1: The study site where most of the research here referred took place. This is Parque Nacional Natural Chingaza in central Colombia, not far from Bogotá. The picture was taken at ~3500 m asl. 9.1 The four thesis papers I was the sole author on these four papers, and this misleading aspect of the situation is relevant for the tale to come. This story starts with the first paper submitted to Physiological and Biochemical Zoology (known then as Physiological Zoology) entitled Metabolic physiology, locomotor performance, and thermal niche breadth in Neotropical anurans (Navas, 1996c). This was my first submitted paper ever, my very first experience publishing in science. To my surprise and joy, this paper was accepted after the first round of review and came back to me with barely any comments. Not only that, I received the most wonderful letter of acceptance a novice author could expect. The letter was signed by Charlotte Mangum, who was back then Chief Editor of Physiological Zoology. By the way, that was the one and only time I got a paper accepted in such a manner. This type of acceptance does happen sporadically, at least to colleagues of mine, but it never happened to me again. During the reflection motivated by this chapter it became clear that, back in those early days of my career, my reading of this acceptance episode had been superficial. Retrospectively, I had failed to understand the full scope of the editorial input by my advisor Ted Taigen and the other two members of my Committee, Kurt Schwenk and Kent Wells (among the best editors I ever met). To be clear, I fully acknowledged their help and knew that the papers to be submitted had improved substantially from their editorial skills. But their presence in this first paper was much deeper. It was pervasive in the organisation of the ideas and in a thinking method that, I learned later, I had not fully developed yet. I guess I was less independent in my writing that I thought I was. Anyhow, this first publishing experience planted a naïve seed of illusion in which publication was a smooth process. That seed germinated and died. My next submissions buried it. My next two papers were submitted soon after the acceptance of the Physiological Zoology paper, which had been unusually rapid. I also had editorial help in these two next papers, particularly by Kent Wells, but comparatively less in the sense that editorial feedback came in the shape of comments on my writing more so than from fundamentals of the paper itself. Also, I had one round of input which I interpreted and applied to create the final versions of twin papers sent to Journal of Herpetology. These papers were: The effect of temperature on the vocal activity of tropical anurans: a comparison of high and low-elevation species (Navas, 1996a) and Thermal dependency of field locomotor and vocal performance of high-elevation anurans in the tropical Andes (Navas, 1996b). Obviously, this time I did not get two wonderful letters of acceptance. The first of these two papers came with 14 major points to consider and respond to, and the second with 12. The fact that I remember comments line by line reflects the impact that this feedback had on me. Besides, iconic herpetologist Maureen A. Donnelly signed the more critical review. My first reaction was despair. The comments involved a reconstruction of important parts of the paper, new data analysis, remaking figures, and deep review of several analytic aspects of the discussion. But the editor had offered me a chance to resubmit, in case I could handle the considerable and fundamental comments. I had to try. The advice I received from my seniors was to analyse the comments carefully and to isolate the main issues. Are those criticisms pertinent? Can they help to improve your paper? I was also told to wait a few days and read the reviews again with a cold head. This was such good advice that I adopted it as common practice and still do the same thing today. About a week later I read the reviews again, and only then I was able to appreciate that a) the criticisms were well-intentioned, clear, and important, and b) the paper would improve notably with that input. After much hard work I was able to address each comment and resubmit the manuscripts. Additional minor subsequent changes were necessary, but finally, after the second round of review, both papers were accepted. To finish, the last paper in this story was: Implications of microhabitat selection and patterns of activity on the thermal ecology of high elevation Neotropical anurans (Navas, 1996d). In brief, the review was challenging, with many significant comments, but a much better paper came out of two rounds of revision. 9.2 Looking back In retrospect, this first set of papers derived from my doctoral thesis taught me important lessons. One is obvious, that publication of science is not easy. Another is that my colleagues invest good time in revising my work, as I do for theirs, and this investment of time has to be appreciated. Receiving criticisms may not be pleasant, but papers do improve thanks to this peer input. I was lucky to receive well-meant criticisms during those early stages of my career, and as a subsequent dominant trend. Occasionally, I have received terrible reviews, but those were mostly paired with mediocre submissions. Unfair, or just unkind, reviews have been rare, though present in my career. Also, it does happen that sometimes a reviewer misses an important point, but I also have done this when reviewing for my peers. My main advice, then, is unlikely to be surprising. Do take reviews seriously, analyse them with a cold head, and focus first on the ideas. The likelihood that reviews improve your paper is high. And rejection is just part of the process. Persistence is necessary. There is one final issue, perhaps more ethereal, but one whose understanding meant a lot to me. When comparing first versions I wrote, the main difference between the first paper cited in this chapter and the next three was not in the quality of the data, the merit of analysis, the scientific precision, or the relevance of the research. The main difference was about storytelling, in the sense of narrative quality. It is hard to put this into words, but that first paper had a story to which my senior colleagues contributed substantially. I am proud to have had those people nearby when I was germinating as a science writer, and their example and teachings have been of uttermost value since. My subsequent attempts were more accounts than stories, and my peers, consciously or not, noticed this. Yet, reviewers have helped me to improve my writing ever since, a process that is still ongoing. Even when the result is a rejection. References Navas CA. 1996a.

Every so often, you hear about that mythological creature, the scientist who has never had a paper rejected. Most of us, though, begin to accumulate rejections as soon as we begin to submit papers. I myself have been rejected by ~20 different journals, from Science to the Northeastern Naturalist. Ive gotten rude reviews, kind reviews, superficial reviews, insightful reviews, and just-plain-wrong reviews. Editors have made fair decisions about most of my papers, but have rejected some of my best papers, and accepted some papers that probably needed work. Not surprisingly, its the rejections, rather than the easy passes, that we authors remember. Each rejected paper has its own story. Ive chosen to tell the story of what I think of as one of my best papers (Strayer, 1999), which was soundly rejected, twice. Freshwater mussels (Figure 10.1) are distributed very patchily in streams (Figure 10.2 bottom panels); some small patches on the streambed contain lots of mussels, but large areas support few or no mussels. Previous papers (e.g. Strayer &amp; Ralley, 1993) had shown that conventional explanations for local distribution of stream macroinvertebrates (e.g., current speed, sediment grain size) failed to account for mussel distribution. FIGURE 10.1: The brook floater (Alasmidonta varicosa). One of the mussel species living at the Neversink River study site. I had the idea that local differences in disturbance severity and frequency might account for mussel distributions. Mussels are long-lived (typically 5-50 years, Haag, 2012) compared to the frequency of floods strong enough to move stream sediments (floods typically mobilize stream sediments every 1-2 years). Maybe mussels live on little bits of the streambed that are stable during floods. I thought that we could test this idea by marking stones on the streambed, waiting for a flood, and seeing whether the marked stones survived in the mussel patches but were swept away elsewhere. My faithful assistants marked and set out thousands of stones into two small rivers (Figure 10.3) with mapped patches of mussels  so much work! As luck would have it, we got big floods the first winter, and the results strongly supported our idea  we recovered marked rocks in the mussel beds but few elsewhere (Figure 10.2). FIGURE 10.2: The results of counting mussels. Probability of a marked rock remaining in place through a flood (upper panels) and mussel density (number/m2) in two small rivers in New York, modified from Strayer (1999). Note the spatial coincidence between the distributions of rocks and mussels. I thought this was a really good study - so I wrote it up and sent it to Freshwater Biology. The journal flatly rejected it  not revise and resubmit, not send to a different journal, but reject. The criticisms all looked either wrong or addressable to me. One reviewer objected to the absence of statistical testing of what I thought was an obvious match of rock and mussel distributions, so I invented what I thought was a nifty new statistical test (independently proposed by Roxburgh &amp; Chesson, 1998) and added it to the paper. I thought that the paper was even better, and a good match to the journal, so I wrote back to the editor, asking him to reconsider the paper. He agreed, and the revised paper went out to review, only to be once again rejected. This might have been a good point to give up on the paper, or at least radically rework it. But even with the benefit of two sets of negative reviews and editors comments, I still thought that this paper was fundamentally sound, so I revised it once more, and sent it to the Journal of the North American Benthological Society. They accepted it after minor revision and published it without incident. The paper has been a modest success, with 281 cites on Google Scholar and 131 cites on Web of Science, as of 21 Aug 2021. Gratifyingly, citation rates have been rising, with the highest citation rates yet occurring 20 years after publication. I flatter myself into thinking that perhaps this twice-rejected paper has thus either inspired or anticipated mussel research over the past couple of decades. 10.1 Figure out how to handle rejections If youre an academic researcher, your proposals and papers are going to get rejected, fairly or unfairly, so you should figure out how to handle and even benefit from rejections, rather than stewing over them and letting them harm your life and career. Here are a few things that have helped me. Ive learned that its always worth thinking carefully about the feedback that you get, even if it is harshly negative. Reviews often include good advice for improving your paper (like adding that statistical test). If a review contains criticism that is off-base or wrong, Ive learned to ask myself whether poor communication on my part, and not just stupidity on the reviewers part, might have led to the unwarranted criticism. Ive been dismayed at how often Ive found unclear writing when I went back to look at a criticized paper. Better communicating your results and ideas can keep future readers from making the same mistake that the reviewer did. Finally, Ive learned that its ok to reject and ignore criticisms that are unfair or irrelevant  reviewers are not always right! But you should reach this conclusion only after you have carefully thought about the reviews, with as open a mind as is possible. As a corollary to this, I learned never to write a response to reviews or resubmit a paper right after I get the reviews, when Im still hot and most want to write that response. Now, I read the reviews, put everything aside for a week, then get to the hard work of deciding how to respond. Ive learned not to give up on a rejected paper if Im convinced of its value, even after negative reviews. Some of my favorite papers were first rejected (Strayer, 1983, 1999 and more, 2020; Strayer, Hattala &amp; Kahnle, 2004; e.g. Strayer &amp; Malcom, 2006), but I was able to use what I learned from these initial rejections to improve the papers and publish them, sometimes in a better journal. Ive learned that once a paper has been rejected by a journal, its probably best to move on to another journal, rather than persisting with the first journal. I have heard of cases where a journal reversed a decision about rejection, but its rare, and it never happened to me. More often, going back to the original journal led to further delays and frustration. There are plenty of good journals for your work. FIGURE 10.3: Mussels occur in patches in streams. One of the study sites, Webatuck Creek, during typical summer water levels (left) and during a late-summer flood (right). 10.2 The hard part The hard part, which I still struggle with, is knowing whether to listen to expert voices saying that your work is flawed or worthless, or to your inner voice saying that your work is good or important. Critics, even eminent ones, can be wrong, and we all know of examples where only an authors persistence saved a great piece of work from oblivion. James Joyce sent his Dubliners, now considered to be one of the greatest short story collections in the English language, 18 times to 15 different publishers over a nine-year period before it was finally published. So maybe your rejected work really is good (though probably not as good as Dubliners), and you should revise and resubmit it as many times as it takes to get funded or published. On the other hand, I know of plenty of examples in which a scientist (sometimes me!) wasted a lot of time pushing a stale or flawed idea that didnt deserve to be published. Its easy to overvalue the novelty and importance of your own work. Pursuing a bad or mediocre manuscript can waste time that you dont have to waste as an early career scientist, and harm your reputation among colleagues. I can offer only two suggestions to help you balance your inner voice and the outer critics. First, if you can, find out whether you tend to overvalue or undervalue your own work. This can help you decide whether you need to adjust the volume of your inner voice up or down. Second, try to find one or a few people who have the good judgement, good will, and time to serve as an honest critic of your ideas. Such people are hard to find, but can be invaluable, especially if you can keep them over the course of your career. But in the end, you will need to make your own hard decisions about whether the negative critics are right, and when to give up or sink more time into rejected proposals and papers.

I was employed by the Department of Forestry, and based at the Jonkershoek Forestry Research Centre near Stellenbosch, South Africa. It was a time when the Department was about to embark on an ambitious program to introduce prescribed burning to vast areas of mountain fynbos, and they needed scientific studies to provide a basis for knowing how often, and when, to burn. It was an exciting period to be a researcher in this field, because at that time the entire collection of scientific papers about the ecology of fynbos could be stored in a single small folder. It was also conventional to write a thesis as a single, stand-alone document, but universities were beginning to experiment with the idea of preparing each chapter as a paper that could be submitted to a journal for publication. Consequently, I was advised to follow this route. My study examined the effects of frequency of burning on fynbos vegetation. I used three sites to compare outcomes  one that was burnt every four years, one that burnt every 20 years or so, and one that had been protected from fire for 37 years. I had two potentially publishable papers in my thesis, one that dealt with the botanical composition of the sites, and one with the above-ground biomass. My research confirmed that burning at four-year intervals eliminated tall proteas (family Proteaceae), reducing the vegetation to a short stature with low biomass. Burning every 20 years resulted in stands of healthy proteas, with much more above-ground biomass. Protection from fire for longer periods resulted in the proteas becoming senescent, with excessive amounts of dead, dry material above ground. At the time, it was policy that all research done in the department had to be published in the South African Forestry Journal, which was not rigorously peer-reviewed. My academic supervisor, Dr Eugene Moll at UCT, thought that the biomass paper would be suitable for an international journal, and encouraged me to submit it to the Journal of Ecology. This break with protocol required lengthy negotiations with the department, but in the end they allowed me to submit the paper to the journal. FIGURE 11.1: Proteas growing in the fynbos. The fynbos is a fire-dependent vegetation, but if fires dont burn frequently enough, proteas like these can become senescent and die. 11.1 Submitting the manuscript Things were very different in those days. Everything was done on hard copies, and we used the postal service to submit and receive documents. Receipt was acknowledged with postcards. Manuscripts were prepared with a device called a typewriter, and figures had to be prepared by hand using graphic artists and manufactured sheets of typefaces and other elements (e.g. Letraset) that were transferred manually to the artwork. Once my manuscript on the effects of fire frequency on fynbos biomass was ready, I placed it (and three additional copies to be posted on to reviewers) all into an envelope, stuck stamps on it, and posted it off to England. If I could have held my breath and kept my fingers crossed for the next three months, I would have done so. Eventually, a large manilla envelope, festooned with British stamps and addressed to Doctor BW van Wilgen appeared in my postbox. In it was a covering letter from the editor handling the manuscript, who said that the journal may be interested in publishing the paper, provided that rather a lot of changes were made to bring the paper up to a standard that they would be happy with. Accompanying this was a copy of each reviewers comments, and a copy of the manuscript from the editor with corrections indicated in pen. Some words were crossed out, others were added, and words or parts of sentences were ringed, with arrows showing where they should be moved to new positions. When I looked at this, I could see that the editor obviously knew their stuff, and that they had done one heck of a lot to improve my grammar, syntax and logic. I very carefully attended to all of this, prepared a new manuscript, and posted it back to England. At this point, there was no knowing whether or not I would be able to get my manuscript accepted in an international journal. It was very important to me, but I knew I would have to wait again for the outcome. This time, only two months passed before another envelope arrived in my postbox. It was more reviewer comments and another painstakingly marked-up version of my manuscript, with a cover letter expressing appreciation for my clumsy attempts to improve the paper, and requesting a further round of corrections. I worked through all of this again, and prepared a marked-up version for the typist to attend to. The typist indicated that it would have to go into the queue of other work, and that they would not be able to realistically get to it before the end of next week. I was appalled at this delay. I then, somewhat foolishly, decided to re-type the manuscript myself to speed things up. This was a painstaking process, as I had no training. I had to search for each letter on the keyboard before hitting the lever that imprinted the letter onto the paper. I used the two index fingers on both hands to do this, which made me look like a chicken pecking at seeds on the ground (it is a technique I use to this day, much to the amusement of my colleagues, but I am a little faster now). Of course, any mistake you made meant that you had to start the whole page over again. Needless to say, the typist cleared their backlog before I was halfway done, and rapidly completed the job for me. Another round of review followed, and this time the manuscript was returned requiring further, but much less extensive, changes. These I attended to, and received by return of post a letter saying that the handling editor was happy with the paper, and would now pass it on to the Editor-in-Chief for a final decision. To my dismay, another marked-up version appeared in my post box about a month later. Further edits were required. The editor also wanted the title of the article to change from effects of fire frequency to effects of post-fire age, saying that it was with consternation that he noted that this rather fundamental point had not yet been picked up. He also told me to remove a figure, in which I had drawn curved lines through three data points showing how live biomass first increased, and then decreased, with increasing post-fire age, while at the same time the mass of dead material increased at first gradually, the exponentially. He told me that my carefully-prepared figure owed more to art than to science, so I replaced it with a written description. After this, my paper was accepted in the Journal of Ecology, and finally appeared in print one and a half years after the first submission: van Wilgen (Van Wilgen, 1982). FIGURE 11.2: Brian van Wilgen collecting plot data in the fynbos, 1978. This frequently-burnt plot of fynbos is dominated by small shrubs and herbaceous plants, and large, relatively slow-maturing proteas have been completely eliminated. 11.2 Looking back I was immensely proud of this paper. I had managed to get published in a leading international journal, and I was on my way to becoming a real scientist. Other scientists around me had taken what was considered to be the required route for publishing, namely to send the papers to the departments in-house publishers. Posting a manuscript overseas was like a leap into the unknown, but after a huge amount of effort, it had paid off. This was thanks in no small part to some quality editing on the part of the journal, something that is not always the case today. More importantly, the process had taught me lessons that have stood me in good stead ever since. These included the importance of saying what was necessary in as few words as possible, and how to structure a logical progression from introduction, through methods and results to discussion. Most of all, it taught me the importance of attention to detail. Researchers in the 21st century have constant access to word processors, graphics packages for preparing figures, statistical packages for analyzing data, and online access to published papers. While all of this has made it so much easier to write and produce papers, it also makes it easy to cut corners and sometimes to become sloppy. When you can simply add, delete or move a sentence without having to retype the whole page (or add a paragraph without having to retype the rest of the manuscript), you could inadvertently make things worse. My advice would always be to spend additional time getting things as close as possible to perfect the first time around. It will increase the chances of your paper getting a positive reception, and in the long run save time in the revision stages. References Van Wilgen BW. 1982.

Its great to share and reflect on our journeys, and I know that Ive enjoyed looking back on my own publishing story. I had this idea when I was out on a run. Im constantly amazed that running time is so productive in terms of generating ideas, rethinking plans and experiments. I love my running space. Its inspirational on so many levels. Heres a snap I took that day from the highest point: By this point in the run (17:00 on 19 August 2021), Id had the idea and decided to go home and get it ready for people to contribute. From this point, its mostly downhill. If you ever feel that you need some inspiration, I urge you to get out into your world and move as you think.
